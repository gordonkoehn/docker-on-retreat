We have a small python script that relies on a few dependenceies installed via Conda . Out python script has requires some imput files and prints and creates some output. A typical flow of a scientific investigation. Prerequisites This workbook is meant for a quick life demo, hence it may be better to just follow. Yet if you want to take the challange. Please make sure your machine is set up. Install Docker on your local computer and create an account on dockerhub . You can find instructions here . Note that you need admin rights to install and use Docker, and if you are installing Docker on Windows, you need a recent Windows version. Please also login into your docker hub account in the Docker GUI or with docker login If working on Windows During the course exercises you will be mainly interacting with docker through the command line. Although windows powershell is suitable for that, it might cause some issues with bind mounting directories. Hence, it is easier to follow the exercises if you have a UNIX or \u2018UNIX-like\u2019 terminal. You can get one by using WSL2. With VScode, you can also add the WSL extension. Make sure you install the latest versions before installing docker. Creating your Program. Our example program is in src/main.py . Let's check it out: - We import some libaries, supported by our virtual envrioment manager Conda . See environment.yml . - We get out input and output paths. - We import the data. Two float numbers. - We do some heavy computation with numpy . - We do some Output Formating with a cool, but uselless tool called figlet . You'll see. - We save the result, to the output file and console. Make a docker out of it. Make sure you are in the root directory of this project. docker build . What just happend? This command refers to the Docker Engine, the Runtime engine of this particular containerization technology. This command be default looks in the current directory for the container Manifest , for Dockers the Dockerfile . It contains all the instructions to make the image. The above command did just that. It build the image given the instructions in the manifest. So where is the image ? We'll it's not a file you see. But you can check for it with: docker image list Let's properly name out container now. docker build -t beatenberg:v1 . Let's check again docker image list Now you should see your container with a tag in the list. Let's check the input and output files in in/input.csv and out/output.txt . Let's now run the docker locally. Because we have input and output files we need to mount these directories. As a container isolates your application with seemingly its own operating system and file system. To get data in and out, you need to mount. We already saw which are the directories used inside of the container. Next, we define their equivalent outside of the container and run it. The next command takes the image we just created and makes a container out of it. docker run -v $(pwd)/in:/app/in -v $(pwd)/out:/app/out beatenberg:v1 To be explicit we need to pass the .env file, here we just relied on the defaults. docker run --env-file .env -v $(pwd)/in:/app/in -v $(pwd)/out:/app/out beatenberg:v1 Woha, this worked. And it's quite useful. This gets useful if your installation is complicated or unreliable across machines. Note that this container just runs and exits, that's usually what we want on a cluster. Let's look inside for context. docker run -v $(pwd)/in:/app/in -v $(pwd)/out:/app/out -it beatenberg:v1 /bin/bash There is our applciaiton. And look its ubuntu.
